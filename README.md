# BrainTumorSegmentation
Brain Tumor Segmentation using U-Net on LGG MRI dataset - A deep learning pipeline built with TensorFlow/Keras for semantic segmentation of brain tumors from MRI images.


This project performs **semantic segmentation** on brain MRI scans using the **U-Net architecture**, identifying and outlining brain tumors. The entire training and evaluation pipeline runs in **Google Colab** ‚Äî no local setup required.

## Dataset

- **Name**: LGG Brain MRI Segmentation Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)
- **Contents**: Paired MRI slices and segmentation masks

üìå You will need to upload your `kaggle.json` file to authenticate and download the dataset in Colab.

---

##  Model: U-Net

U-Net is a CNN architecture specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. It consists of:

- **Contracting path** (encoder)
- **Expanding path** (decoder)
- **Skip connections** for feature reuse
